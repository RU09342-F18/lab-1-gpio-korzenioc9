# Off Board Blink
This part of the lab required removing the processor from the microcontroller and placing it on a breadboard. The same code used in "Multiple Blink" was used for this application, and the processor was loaded with this program and placed on the breadboard. Then, referencing the datasheet, the appropriate pins of the processor were wired indidually to power, LEDs, and ground. The controller board without the processor was used to 3.3V supply power and ground to the breadboard. Using jumpers, DVCC (pin 1) and reset (pin 24) were wired to 3.3V power, and DVSS (pin 20) was wired to ground. Pins 1.0 and 1.6 (pins 2 and 14) were connected to LEDs, which shared a ~2000 ohm path to ground using two 1K ohm resistors in series. This ground resistance was added to limit the current from pins 1.0 and 1.6 to below 2mA, the limit specified in the datasheet. 

The equation used to calculate the output current was: (3.3 - 0.7)/2000 = 1.3mA
